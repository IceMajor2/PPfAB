# Photomosaics

Create images out of other images! This program divides an inputted picture into a set of bigger pixels. Next, it assigns an image (from the provided *dataset*) to each of them.

And voil√†!

Install Maven and run `mvn clean compile exec:java` inside the project's directory. Have fun!
