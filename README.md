# programming-projects-for-advanced-begginers
A couple of projects that I've tried to implement with the help of [Robert's Heaton blog series](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/). It has introduced me hands-on to the importance of planning as well as gave me a better perspective on data handling & algorithms power.

Projects are interesting and they touch on diverse subjects making the whole experience quite a rollercoaster. From computationally demolishing everyone that I play with ([Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/IceMajor2/programming-projects-for-advanced-begginers/tree/main/TicTacToe)) through quite-low-level introduction to databases ([UserLogins](https://github.com/IceMajor2/programming-projects-for-advanced-begginers/tree/main/UserLogins)) and observing the evolution of cells ([GameOfLife](https://github.com/IceMajor2/programming-projects-for-advanced-begginers/tree/main/GameOfLife)) to creating your avatar using [Photomosaics](https://github.com/IceMajor2/programming-projects-for-advanced-begginers/tree/main/Photomosaics) and [ASCII Art](https://github.com/IceMajor2/programming-projects-for-advanced-begginers/tree/main/ASCIIArt).

If you're an (advanced) beginner, I would strongly recommend you to go through this journey giving your all.

## ASCII Art
Program that rewrites an image using ASCII characters.

## Photomosaics
Transform images using... images.

## SnakeGame
Maybe not as good as the [original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)), but hey!

## TicTacToe
No need to worry about ever losing to your friend in TicTacToe again.

## UserLogins
Not really useful in practice, but a great starting project to the databases.
